The pyranges module
-------------------

The pyranges module exposes the class :class:`PyRanges <pyranges.PyRanges>` (omitted in this page)
as well as a number of functions for reading data from commonly used file formats:

.. automodule:: pyranges
    :members:
    :imported-members:  # Ensure this is set to include imported members
    :exclude-members: PyRanges
