The pyranges module
-------------------

The pyranges module exposes the class :class:`PyRanges <pyranges.PyRanges>` (omitted in this page)
as well as a number of functions for reading data from commonly used file formats.
You also have an :ref:`pyranges.option <pyranges_options>` interface to
configure how PyRanges objects are represented.


.. automodule:: pyranges
    :members:
    :imported-members:  # Ensure this is set to include imported members
    :exclude-members: PyRanges, RangeFrame

.. _pyranges_options:
pyranges.options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``pyranges.options`` object is used to configure aspects of how PyRanges is represented.
Below are the methods available on this object.

.. automodule:: pyranges.options
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :exclude-members: __init__
